# Changelog - Pancake

## Active version in development
### Changes

## v1.5.0
- LIS performance improvements.
- Streamlined the SISD DP chaining procedure. Removed all but one branching in the inner loop.
- Reusing the memory for SISD DP chaining in MapperCLR.
- Implemented SSE4.1 DP Chaining. It's turned off by default, user needs to specify Meson option 'sse41' to compile this feature, otherwise the SISD version is used.
- Improved sorting time in MapperCLR.

## v1.4.1
- Added a time profiling feature. Turned off by default. Enable by specifying the `-Dtime=true` Meson option, or the `PANCAKE_ENABLE_TIMINGS` macro.

## v1.4.0
 - Added a CLI option `--smart-hit-per-target` to the `ovl-hifi` subtool.  For a query/target pair, this labels supplementary and secondary overlaps for that pair only. It discards secondary alignments, but keeps all supplementary. These supplementary alignments all have to be on the same strand.
 - Added `dynamicBandwidth` boolean to `AlignmentParameters` that allows iterative KSW2 bandwidth exploration.
 - GCC11 fixes.
 - Feature: added configurable maximum seed occurrence threshold to MapperCLR. This adds 3 new settings to the MapperCLRMapSettings: `seedOccurrenceMin`, `seedOccurrenceMax` and `seedOccurrenceMaxMemory`.
 - Feature: Cudaaligner updates.
 - Fixed the CLI command line help for almost all subtools.
 - Tools no longer throw an exception when the input SeqDB is empty. Instead, they just return with empty output.
 - Catching exceptions and returning empty results in all public interfaces of: MapperHiFi, MapperCLR, MapperBatchCPU and MapperBatchGPU.
 - Bugfix in `seqdb-dump`. Wrong sequence length was used to write the sequences.
 - Added alignment optimality checking to AlignerKSW2.
 - Bugfix in MapperBatchGPU, wrong bandwidth passed to the aligner.
 - Added an alignment tool function "ComputeSimpleRepeatMask". It computes a mask of simple repeats (HPs, dinuc, trinuc, etc.).
 - Refactored the batch aligner classes. They now have the same base class.
 - Unit tests for ChainHits.
 - Variant strings are no longer written when the CIGAR is not output, in `ovl-hifi`.

## v1.3.0
### Version
- `pancake` - commit 1c1b037270bdd39b96aafc4e537345878cf4c923 (April 02, 2021), `pancake 1.3.0 (commit SL-release-10.0.0-557-g1c1b037)`

### Changes
- Arbitrary sequence IDs - sequences can now have an arbitrary numeric ID for mapping. Previously, the IDs of sequences needed to be consecutive and starting from 0.
- CollectHits now reverses the query coordinate instead of the target coordinate if the seeds are on the opposite strands. This allows for simplification of a lot of the code, and perhaps some efficiency improvement.
- Minor refactoring of the SeedIndex.
- GPU CIGAR conversion for the MapperBatchGPU. This is no longer performed on the CPU, and this improves the efficiency of this mapper.
- Removed the `maxHPCLen` parameter from minimizer computation. There is no longer an upper limit on the length of the homopolymers for compression. The `--max-hpc-len` parameter is now removed from `pancake seeddb`.
- Bugfixes for edge cases in minimizer computation: first window had a bug when multiple equal keys are there; spaced seeds could have omitted minimizers in the first window.
- Bugfix for negative seed hit spans (when the span of a seed ran over the range of the signed 8-bit ints).

## v1.2.0
### Version
- `pancake` - commit 2f05f3e16219291485de130f7ca68dc40ae7c5c5 (Mar 11, 2021), `pancake 1.2.0 (commit SL-release-10.0.0-417-g2f05f3e)`

### Changes
- The `AlignmentResult` now stores the number of alignment differences, so that the client doesn't have to parse the CIGAR string again. Updated the aligners to produce the diff counts.
- `FastaSequenceCachedStore` implementation. This is a store for `FastaSequenceCached` objects, which are like a "view" into the FASTA sequences (they do not own the data, only point to it). This is now used in the `SeqDBReaderCachedBlock`.
- Generic interface to `MapperHiFi`. It's now possible to run a single function which takes a set of `std::string` targets and queries, and maps/aligns them.
- Added the SeqDB dump tool (`seqdb-dump`) to dump the entire DB or just one block.
- Added the SeqDB info tool (`seqdb-info`) to display information about the SeqDB (length, N50, etc.).
- Minor refactoring, versioning code.
- (non-IPA related) KSW2 third-party library now removed from Pancake, and used from Pbcopper.
- (non-IPA related) Refactoring the MapperCLR: parametrized the flankExtensionFactor setting ; and always computing alignment regions during mapping, instead of only when performing alignment.
- (non-IPA related) `AlignerBatchCPU` implementation - an aligner which first takes a batch of sequence pairs, then performs alignment of all submitted pairs in parallel, on CPU.
- (non-IPA related) `MapperBatchCPU` implementation - a batch mapper which first takes a batch of sequence pairs, then performs mapping of sequences in parallel on the CPU. Following that, the mappings are aligned in batch using the AlignerBatchCPU in parallel on the CPU.
- (non-IPA related) `AlignerBatchGPU` - analogous to the AlignerBatchGPU, but uses the Cudaaligner (GenomeWorks) to perform alignment of the sequence pairs on the GPU.
- (non-IPA related) `MapperBatchGPU` - analogous to the `MapperBatchCPU`, but this uses the GPU aligner to align sequences. Mapping is still performed on the CPU, same as with the `MapperBatchCPU`.
- (non-IPA related) Abstract class `MapperBatchBase` added, and `MapperBatchCPU` and `MapperBatchGPU` now both inherit the interface.
- (non-IPA related) Optional dependency injection of the FireAndForget object into the `AlignerBatchCPU`, `MapperBatchCPU` and `MapperBatchGPU` to better handle kernel overload.
- All CLR mappers (MapperCLR, MapperBatchCPU, MapperBatch GPU) can now optionally skip/mock perfect alignments, and skip symmetric overlaps. (Mocking means that if a self-hit is detected based on sequence IDs, a perfect alignment result will be generated without actually computing the alignment.)
- Fixed the bestNSecondary in MapperCLR::Map_ where it did not properly respect the value < 0. (Instead of reporting all alignments, only some were reported.)
- The batch mappers (MapperBatchCPU, MapperBatchGPU) can accept custom mapping parameters for every chunk in a batch.
- Converted the `unique_ptr` to references in the overlap writers.
- Fixed the score computation in MapperCLR.

## v1.1.0 - SL - Release 10.1.0
### Version
- `pancake` - commit 29844f96d5cf58874a04ffd6a9895abe00a0750b (origin/release/prep) (Dec 16, 2020), `pancake 1.1.0 (commit SL-release-10.0.0-186-g29844f9)`

### Changes
- LIS chaining of seed hits. Improvements in overlap sensitivity by refining seed hits before alignment. The seed hits are now refined using the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm.
- Scalability improvement in Pancake - reduced system time by removing `std::clock()` usage. It turns out that this function is blocking.
- Filtering duplicate overlaps in Pancake, which can occur when there is a larger gap in between seed hits.
- Pbcopper subproject now points to the GitHub mirror.
- GitHub mirror of Pancake now exists: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pancake
- Handling edge cases in alignment explicitly (e.g. when either query or target is of length `0`). Some aligners behaved non-deterministically in these cases.
- Resolved warnings.
- Minor refactoring.
- Encoded seed span. Seed span is now encoded in the Seed structure. The same as in Minimap2. Span of a seed hit in both query and target is now encoded in the SeedHit structure. Seed indexing and hit collection now works correctly in the homopolymer-compressed mode. It also works with the spaced seeds feature. The new maximum kmer size is equal to `28` now. This is because the span is encoded within the seed data structure, so some bits had to be specialized. A lot of tests had to be updated because previously they used the default of `k = 30`.
- (non-IPA related) Added MapperCLR - implemented a CLR mapper, currently available via API.  and several more followups to resolve warnings and improve API
